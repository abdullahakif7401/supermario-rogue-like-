**Super Mario "rogue-like" game**
</p>
<br>
<br>
This is a "rogue-like" text-based game, inspired by the Super Mario game. Rogue-like games are called after the first such software, Rogue, a fantasy game. As it is inspired by Super Mario, it has several similar characters, items, locations and concepts.
<br>
A few concepts of the game are mentioned below:
- A Tree has three stages/cycles and each stage has a unique spawning ability. It takes 10 turns to grow into the next stage. 
- The physical currency that the Actor can collect is the coin($), each coin has an integer value.
- When the actor is standing next to the high ground, the actor can jump onto it. Going up requires a jump, but going down doesn't require it (the actor can walk normally). Each jump has a certain success rate. If the jump is unsuccessful, the actor will fall and get hurt. The success rate and fall damage are determined by its destination ground.
- When Mario consumes Super Mushroom (a magical item), he can jump freely with a 100% success rate and no fall damage.
- The enemy cannot jump at all, but it can walk down to the lower ground normally.
- **Enemies** present in the game are: Goomba(g), Koopa(K), Bowser(B), Piranha Plant(Y), Flying Koopa(F).
- Once the enemy is engaged in a fight (the Player attacks the enemy or the enemy attacks you - when the player stands in the enemy's surroundings), it will follow the Player.
- **Magical Item** present in the game are: Super Mushroom(^), Power Star(*), Bottle(b), Health Fountain(H), Power Fountain(A).
- Consuming a Super Mushroom: increases max HP by 50 and allows actor to jump freelt with a 100% success rate and no fall damage.
- Consuming a Power Star: heals actor by 200 hit points and makes actor invincible for 10 turns.
- Mario can refill Bottle from Health Fountain and Power Fountain.
- Drinking Health Fountain water increases hit points by 50.
- Drinking Power Fountain water increases base attack damage by 15.
- Coins can be used to buy Wrench, Super Mushroom and Power Star from a friendly character, Toad(O), standing in the middle of the map surrounded by brick walls.

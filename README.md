<br>
A few concepts of the game are mentioned below:
- A Tree has three stages/cycles and each stage has a unique spawning ability. It takes 10 turns to grow into the next stage. 
- When the actor is standing next to the high ground, the actor can jump onto it. Going up requires a jump, but going down doesn't require it (the actor can walk normally). Each jump has a certain success rate. If the jump is unsuccessful, the actor will fall and get hurt. The success rate and fall damage are determined by its destination ground.
- When Mario consumes Super Mushroom üçÑ (a magical item), he can jump freely with a 100% success rate and no fall damage.
- The enemy cannot jump at all, but it can walk down to the lower ground normally.
- **Enemies** present in the game are: Goomba(g), Koopa(K), Bowser(B), Piranha Plant(Y), Flying Koopa(F).
- Once the enemy is engaged in a fight (the Player attacks the enemy or the enemy attacks you - when the player stands in the enemy's surroundings), it will follow the Player.
- **Magical Item** present in the game are: Super Mushroom(^), Power Star(*), Bottle(b), Health Fountain(H), Power Fountain(A).
